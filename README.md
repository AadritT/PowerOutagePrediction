This is the code repository for the Power Outage Predictive Model. The goal of this project is to predict power outages using climate variables such as precipitation and wind speed.

The main functionalities of the code are:
1. PowerOutageANN.ipynb - Model training and Testing + Hyperparameter Tuning.
2. Data_Preprocessing.ipynb - Filtering out the power outage datasets and combining with weather/climate datasets.
